# Getting started
Follow this guide to get started working on the project.

## Commands
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

By issuing the commands above, you setup all the dependencies required to run the project and run the project in a development mode. The development mode allows you to make changes to the stylesheets without having to refresh the page. 

## Assignment
The only file you are required to modify is `styles/base.less`. __If there are changes to other files the assignment will not be graded.__ There are three images associated with the template `mobile.png`, `tablet.png` and `desktop.png`. The images show how the web should look like when in different devices: desktop / laptop, tablet or mobile. Use the images as references to setup the layout as seen on the images.

## Perfect pixel
We will not be looking at exact pixels to determine if the layout is sufficient or not, but it should resemble the images seen in the template. If they differ by a very small margin, it will be treated as the same.

## Requirements
The layout should be setup using CSS Grid and therefore other layout setups (Flexbox, floats, etc.) will result in a severe reduction.
